#Stardew Valley Mod Collection by dantheman999#

Currently there is only one mod available.

##Variable Grass##
Adds randomised chance for more or less plant growth per day.

**INI Settings**

 - MinIterations - Minimum iterations of grass growing function to perform
 - MaxIterations - Maximum iterations of grass growing function to perform

----------

##Installation##
Assuming you have SMAPI installed, just go to %appdata%\Stardew Valley\Mods and extract the DLL and ini file if there is one. 

You can edit the .ini file for each mod to change how it behaves.

----------

##Developing##
Pull the source, and you will probably notice when you try to build there are a few errors. There are two dependancies at the moment, `SMAPI` and the games EXE itself. You will need to have the game to develop. Add them to the location the references are looking at.
